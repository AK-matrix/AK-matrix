# Arnav

I’m a Computer Science student at NUS who enjoys building things that actually work.

I spend time across software engineering and applied ML, from backend systems and APIs to ML pipelines, optimization, and model integration. I like understanding trade-offs, structuring systems cleanly, and getting end-to-end flows right.

I’ve worked with:
- neural networks and applied machine learning
- backend and full-stack systems
- LLM-based workflows (RAG, LangChain, vector search)
- optimization problems and real-world codebases

## Tools
**Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript / TypeScript, Ruby  
**Frameworks:** React, Rails  
**ML / AI:** PyTorch, NumPy, scikit-learn, LangChain  
**Infra & Other:** SQL, Git, Linux
